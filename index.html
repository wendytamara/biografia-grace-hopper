<p><strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#Name_at_birth">née</a> <strong>Murray</strong>; December 9, 1906 –
   January 1, 1992) was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist">computer scientist</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy">United States Navy</a>
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral_(United_States)">rear admiral.[1]</a> One of the first programmers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard Mark I computer</a>,
    she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent
     programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early
      high-level programming language still in use today.</p>
      <p>Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during <a hrhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_IIef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, but
        she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and
        too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began
         her computing career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that
          was led byhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken"> Howard H. Aiken</a>. In 1949, she joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert%E2%80%93Mauchly_Computer_Corporation">Eckert–Mauchly
          Computer Corporation</a> and was part of the development team that
           designed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC I</a> computer in 1944. It was at Eckert–Mauchly
            that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer
            code could be written in English by using a programming language
             that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that
             code into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a> that would be understood by computers.
              By 1952, Hopper finished her compiler, which was written for
               the A-0 System programming language.[2][3][4][5]</p>
               <p>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department
                  for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of
                   the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she
    participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper
  to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming
      language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea
       of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from
       the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty.
        She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for
 the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.</p>
